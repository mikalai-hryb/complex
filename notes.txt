Kubernetes is an assembly of a master and one or more nodes.
Node is a virtual machine or a physical computer that is going to run some number of different containers
Mater ia a machine or vm with a set of programs to manage nodes
Kubernetes does not build images, it gets them from somewhere else
Developers interact with a Kubernetes cluster by reaching out to this master
Load Balancer takes some outside traffic in the form of network requests and relay these requests into each of our different nodes
We use Kubernetes if we have the need to scale up our application and run multiple different types of containers in different quantities
To deploy something, we update the desired state of the master with a config file
A Pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.
